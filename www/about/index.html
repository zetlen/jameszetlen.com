If you ask me to make a website, I'll probably make a website generator. The fun starts when you ask me to make a website generator.
Unlike a lot of other frontend developers, I didn't find my way here through visual design. I'm more of a verbal person, so I'm good at:</p><ul><li>designing semantic, clear APIs in JavaScript</li><li>writing documentation, and helping other people</li><li>making tools that other people can use regardless of their skill levels</li><li>and writing code that sacrifices nothing in performance, sane architecture, and scalability, while remaining accessible and readable by other people.</li></ul><p>I'm working as a software architect at Volusion, which is both challenging and exciting. </p><p>I devote a lot of time to the rapidly-growing community of Mozu users, so I'm not really available for freelance work. I do offer pithy advice via <a href="mailto:zetlen@gmail.com">email</a>and <a href="https:/github.com/zetlen">GitHub.</a></p><section class="suspects"><h2>Employers</h2><ul class="usual-suspects"><li class="suspect"><div class="suspect-header"><a href="http://mozu.com" class="thumb"><img src="mozu.png"></a><h3><a href="http://mozu.com">Mozu</a></h3><h4>2012-2015</h4></div><p>Mozu is the next-generation eCommerce platform from Volusion, built on microservices and modern Web technologies. I was the first engineer on the Mozu project; I collaborated on a lot of initial, fundamental technology choices. I ended up the architect in charge of the theme engine and frontend developer experience. In this capacity I:</p>
<ul>
<li>developed large portions of the adminstrative app</li>
<li>designed the <strong>Hypr Live</strong> template system, which allows reuse of the same templates on the server and the client</li>
<li>created the Mozu Core Theme, a &quot;starting point&quot; theme which inlined best practices, instructional code, and several single-page shopping apps into one extensible package</li>
<li>made build tools and a package ecosystem for theme developers</li>
<li>wrote two SDKs--one for browsers and one for NodeJS--to integrate with the Mozu layer of RESTful web services.</li>
</ul>

I helped to:</p>
<ul>
<li>overhaul our approach to frontend development</li>
<li>properly separate our concerns</li>
<li>introduce modern JavaScript practices to the team</li>
<li>and organize our codebase into reusable components. 
Before leaving the flagship product team to work on Mozu full-time, I led the project to reskin the administrative control panel for the V13 release. I cleaned up a VBScript codebase and replaced repetitive CSS files with the <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less CSS preprocessor</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>deploying the Convio SaaS platform for national and international nonprofit organizations</li>
<li>collaborating with nonprofit clients on large-scale projects to meet tight deadlines</li>
<li>designing our first social networking integrations</li>
<li>and pioneering the use of dynamic UIs in donation forms. 
*Convio has since been acquired by Blackbaud.</li>

To be clear, I have no problem with my youthful idealism: it was my youthful simulation of cynicism and savvy that I can't stand to think about now.
