  | I like toolmaking. If you ask me to make a website, I'll probably make a website generator. The fun starts when you ask me to make a website generator.
  | Unlike a lot of other frontend developers, I didn't find my way here through visual design. I'm more of a verbal person, so I'm good at:
ul
  li designing semantic, clear APIs in JavaScript
  li writing documentation, and helping other people
  li making tools that other people can use regardless of their skill levels
  li and writing code that sacrifices nothing in performance, sane architecture, and scalability, while remaining accessible and readable by other people.
p I'm working as a software architect at Volusion, which is both challenging and exciting. 
p I devote a lot of time to the rapidly-growing community of Mozu users, so I'm not really available for freelance work. I do offer pithy advice via

        Mozu is the next-generation eCommerce platform from Volusion, built on microservices and modern Web technologies. I was the first engineer on the Mozu project; I collaborated on a lot of initial, fundamental technology choices. I ended up the architect in charge of the theme engine and frontend developer experience. In this capacity I:
         - developed large portions of the adminstrative app
         - designed the **Hypr Live** template system, which allows reuse of the same templates on the server and the client
         - created the Mozu Core Theme, a "starting point" theme which inlined best practices, instructional code, and several single-page shopping apps into one extensible package
         - made build tools and a package ecosystem for theme developers
         - wrote two SDKs--one for browsers and one for NodeJS--to integrate with the Mozu layer of RESTful web services.

        I started at Volusion in 2011, when there were very few specialized frontend developers in the engineering department. I helped to:
         - overhaul our approach to frontend development
         - properly separate our concerns
         - introduce modern JavaScript practices to the team
         - and organize our codebase into reusable components. 
        Before leaving the flagship product team to work on Mozu full-time, I led the project to reskin the administrative control panel for the V13 release. I cleaned up a VBScript codebase and replaced repetitive CSS files with the [Less CSS preprocessor](http://lesscss.org/).

        At Convio I was a technical architect in charge of:
         - deploying the Convio SaaS platform for national and international nonprofit organizations
         - collaborating with nonprofit clients on large-scale projects to meet tight deadlines
         - designing our first social networking integrations
         - and pioneering the use of dynamic UIs in donation forms. 
        *Convio has since been acquired by Blackbaud.

        A Node utility for Windows users, who are plagued with a [strong disagreement between the NPM package resolution strategy and the Windows userland utilities.](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/6960). It's basically a superpowered `npm dedupe`; it aggressively flattens the package hierarchy in an attempt to give you more headroom on Windows.

        My name is on at least one software patent submitted by Volusion. I'm ambivalent about the utility of software patents in general, but this one was a good idea.

        Ten years ago I accidentally went viral by posting a half-ironic picture on the Internet after the 2004 re-election of George Bush. It got a fair bit of news coverage, including some quotes from 20-year-old me that I still cringe upon hearing. To be clear, I have no problem with my youthful idealism: it was my youthful simulation of cynicism and savvy that I can't stand to think about now. Anyway, there are a lot of adorable pictures on this site still.
