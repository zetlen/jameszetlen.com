  | Unlike a lot of other frontend developers, I didn't come to development through visual design. I'm more of a verbal than a visual person, so I'm good at designing semantic, clear APIs in JavaScript, writing documentation, and helping other people. I like making tools that other people can use regardless of their skill levels. I care a lot about making code--that is, the tools that automate computers--accessible to the world outside professional software engineers.
p I'm working as a Software Architect at Volusion, which is exactly as glamorous and important as it sounds. I owe the growing community of Mozu users and theme developers a lot of my time, so I'm not really available for freelance work. I do offer pithy advice via

        Mozu is the next-generation eCommerce platform from Volusion, built on microservices and modern Web technologies. I was the first engineer on the Mozu project; I helped make a lot of initial technology choices, and ultimately I ended up the architect in charge of the theme engine and frontend developer experience. 
         - I developed large portions of the adminstrative app.
         - I designed the **Hypr Live** template system, which allows reuse of the same templates on the server and the client. 
         - I created the Mozu Core Theme, a "starting point" theme which inlined best practices, instructional code, and several single-page shopping apps into a single, extensible package. 
         - I created build tools and a package ecosystem for theme developers.
         - I wrote two SDKs, one for browsers and one for NodeJS, to integrate with the Mozu layer of RESTful web services.

        I started at Volusion in 2011, when there were very few specialized frontend developers in the engineering department. I helped to overhaul our approach to frontend development, properly separate our concerns, introduce modern JavaScript practices to the team, and organize our codebase into reusable components. Before leaving the flagship product team to work on Mozu full-time, I led the project to reskin the administrative control panel for the V13 release. I cleaned up a VBScript codebase and replaced repetitive CSS files with the [Less CSS preprocessor](http://lesscss.org/).

        At Convio I was a Technical Architect in charge of deploying the Convio SaaS platform for national and international nonprofit organizations. I designed our first social networking integrations and pioneered the use of dynamic UIs in donation forms. Convio has since been acquired by Blackbaud.

      p A dynamic AMD shimming plugin for RequireJS, written before the builtin config-based shim was compatible with the r.js compiler. It allowed you to describe the shim--requirements, arguments, and exports--at runtime, and build the shim into compiled assets.

        A Node utility for Windows users, who are plagued with a [strong disagreement between the NPM package resolution strategy and the Windows userland utilities.](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/6960). It's basically a superpowered `npm dedupe`; it aggressively flattens the package hierarchy in an attempt to give you more headroom on Windows.

        My name is on at least one software patent submitted by Volusion. I am ambivalent about both the utility of software patents in general and the readability of this one, but it was a good idea.

        Ten years ago I accidentally went viral by posting a half-ironic picture on the Internet after the 2004 re-election of George Bush. It got a fair bit of news coverage, including some quotes from 20-year-old me that I still cringe upon hearing. To be clear, I have no problem with my youthful idealism: it was my youthful simulation of cynicism and savvy that I can't stand to think about now. Anyway, there are a lot of adorable pictures on this site still.
